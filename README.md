# AI-ML-Assignment-3-Simple-NN
A simple Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) built using TensorFlow/Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. This project demonstrates the core deep learning workflow — data preprocessing, model architecture design, training, evaluation, and prediction — as part of an introductory assignment on Deep Learning fundamentals.
